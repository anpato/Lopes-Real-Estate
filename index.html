      My name is Brian Lopes and this is my story. In 2009 I graduated High School and went off to Business School.
      Throughout my time in College I started taking my real estate courses along with 6 -7 classes a semester and
      working in banking. It was a tough time but I was able to get it done! My goal was to learn everything I could
      in real estate so i could invest in the future. I successfully received my license in 2013.</p><br>

      <p>In 2014 I graduated from Rutgers Business School and went to work in New York City as a production manager.
        After working 70+ hour work weeks behind a computer, I found it wasn't for me. I left my "Safe Job" and went
        into business for my self at Keller Williams and haven't looked back!</p><br />

      <p>I pursued my passion which has always been Real Estate. Currently building my own team to help all my clients
        in providing the best service. I love what I do and its exciting to be able to see the cheer and smiles on my
        client's faces. I have made amazing connections and friends for life doing this, and I cannot wait to see what
        the future holds! Hopefully I can add <p id="cap"><strong>YOU</strong></p> to that list.
